			My Project idea for the codefundo++ challenge
First thing's first, i honestly couldn't come up with a good or maybe practical solution for the problem.So i'm just trying my luck here.
I've built a basic weather app which fetches weather record information from a website and displays it to the end user.
That's it just another android weather app.
